## Greetings! <br> 

I recommend viewing the html first so you can read and/or view the results of the analysis.<br>
This project has three files attached: a dataset from the WorldBank containing 2016 Developement Indicators (this data is unfiltered/cleaned but will be cleaned in the python code), the python file with complete code and markdowns, and lastly, a html so that you can view the K-Means analysis results without having to download data or python. <br>

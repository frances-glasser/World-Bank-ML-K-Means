Greetings! 
I recommend viewing the html first so you can read and/or view the results of the analysis.
This project has three files attached: 
* a dataset from the WorldBank containing 2016 Developement Indicators (this data is unfiltered/cleaned but will be cleaned in the python code).
* the python file with complete code and markdowns.
* an html so that you can view the K-Means analysis results without having to download data or python.
